# Personal-Budget-Planner
The following project is a simple personal budget planner and it is intended to demonstrate my programming skills.

The app includes the following features:
- Add Income/expenses (form with amount, date, category, notes)
- View transaction List (sortable, filterable)
- Monthly Summary (total income, total expenses, balance)
- Charts (spending by category, monthly trend)
- Persistent Storage (local database or JSON file)
